**Drug overdose deaths in Connecticut USA 2012-2018**

I am interested in this topic because it strikes me how drug related deaths are a huge public health problem right now in USA  and also in Canada. In this project I expect to find some trends in terms of age, gender, race and substance related to drug overdose deaths. In addition, I want to see if the problem is decreasing, increasing or is having a constant behavior during the studied period of time 2012 to 2018.   

I found this dataset in kaggle.com as *"Drug overdose deaths Accidental drug related deaths during 2012-2018"* This dataset is owned by Ruchi Bathia. The dataset contains the demographic information of over 5000 persons who died because of a drug related intoxication in Connecticut, United States of America between 2012 to 2018. The dataset include 42 variables such as date of death, age, gender, race, death city, death county, description of injury, cause of death, and if the intoxication was due to substances like cocaine, fentanyl, heroin, ethanol, benzodiazepine, tramadol, morphine, etc. This data was collected between 2012 and 2018. The dataset was created in 2016 by Ruchi Bathia; however the original source is data.gov who created the dataset in 2016 from historical records digitized. The purpose of this dataset is public interest.
